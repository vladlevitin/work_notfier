# Production Environment Variables for Vercel

# Backend API URL
# When deployed on Vercel, the API is on the same domain, so use relative path
# Leave this commented out to use default /api
# VITE_API_URL=/api

# The API will automatically use the backend serverless functions deployed on Vercel
# No separate backend URL needed - everything is in one Vercel project!
