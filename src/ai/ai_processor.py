OFFER (return "OFFER") — The poster is OFFERING services, ADVERTISING themselves, or SEEKING EMPLOYMENT:
- They describe what services THEY can provide
- They list their skills, qualifications, experience, or equipment
- They mention prices, rates, or competitive pricing
- They invite people to contact them for services ("send PM", "ta kontakt", "ring meg")
- They ask rhetorical questions like "Trenger du/noen hjelp?" (Do you/anyone need help?) — this is advertising, NOT requesting
- They use language like "Vi/Jeg tilbyr...", "Vi/Jeg utfører...", "Vi/Jeg kan...", "Vi fikser..."
- They describe their business, company, or professional background
- They list MULTIPLE services they provide
- They cover a WIDE geographic area (e.g. "Oslo og omegn", "Østfold & Oslo") — real requests are at a specific address/location
- Companies looking to HIRE workers for their business
- **JOB SEEKERS**: Someone LOOKING FOR WORK, applying for a job, seeking employment ("søker jobb", "søknad om jobb", "leter etter jobb", "på utkikk etter jobb", "looking for work")
- **CV/RESUME posts**: Someone presenting themselves, their experience, and contact info to get hired
- People saying "I can do X, Y, Z — contact me" or "I'm available for work"
- People describing themselves and asking others to hire them
- Short/vague posts that just advertise a service without a specific task (e.g. "Need cleaning? Send PM")

REQUEST (return "REQUEST") — The poster NEEDS someone to do a specific job for them:
- They describe a SPECIFIC task they need done (e.g., "need help moving a sofa", "need a plumber for my bathroom", "looking for someone to paint my apartment")
- They mention a SPECIFIC location where the work needs to happen (an address, building, apartment, specific neighborhood)
- They use language like "Trenger hjelp med...", "Ser etter noen som kan...", "Noen som kan...?"
- They are an individual person needing a specific service performed
- They ask for price quotes or availability FOR A SPECIFIC JOB
- The post contains DETAILS about the job (dimensions, materials, what exactly needs to be done)

KEY DISTINCTIONS:
- "Trenger du/noen hjelp med...?" (Do you/someone need help with...?) = OFFER (advertising to potential customers)
- "Trenger noen hjelp til å vaske huset?" = OFFER (asking if anyone needs cleaning — they're offering the service)
- "Trenger hjelp med..." / "Trenger hjelp til..." (I need help with...) = REQUEST (the poster needs help)
- "Søker jobb" / "Leter etter jobb" / "Søknad om jobb" = OFFER (seeking employment)
- "Jeg kan gjøre X" (I can do X) = OFFER (advertising skills)
- "Trenger noen til å gjøre X" (Need someone to do X) = REQUEST (looking for a worker)
- Short post + "send PM" + wide area = OFFER (advertising)
- Detailed post + specific location + specific task = REQUEST (genuine job)

When in doubt, classify as OFFER — we only want genuine requests where someone needs a specific job done.

EXAMPLES:
- "Trenger noen hjelp til å vaske huset? Østfold & Oslo og omegn. Send gjerne en pm" → OFFER (asking if anyone needs cleaning, advertising)
- "Hei! Vi utfører alt av maling, sparkling og tapetsering. Ta kontakt!" → OFFER (advertising services)
- "Søknad om jobb. Mitt navn er X, jeg har erfaring med Y..." → OFFER (job seeker)
- "Trenger hjelp med å flytte en sofa fra 3. etasje ned til bilen. Bor på Grünerløkka." → REQUEST (specific task, specific location)
- "Noen som kan skifte registerreim på en Peugeot 106?" → REQUEST (specific task needed)
- "Hei! Trenger hjelp til å legge gips i et kjellerrom over panel" → REQUEST (specific task)

AVAILABLE CATEGORIES:
{category_desc}

Post Title: {title}
Post Content: {text}

Instructions:
- Choose exactly ONE primary category — the MAIN task the person needs done.
- Also list any secondary categories if the post involves additional tasks from other categories. Only include secondary categories that are clearly mentioned — don't guess.
- "Car Mechanic" is for work DONE ON a vehicle (repairs, brakes, tires, engine, inspections, tow bar/tilhengerfeste installation, car painting/lakkering, software updates on cars). If someone needs something installed or fixed ON their car, it's Car Mechanic.
- "Transport / Moving" is ONLY for physically moving/transporting items from place A to place B, helping someone relocate to a new address, or needing a driver/sjåfør for transport/taxi. NOT for installing parts on vehicles. NOT for relocating a kitchen/bathroom/room within a home — that's a renovation/plumbing job.
- "IT / Tech" is ONLY for computer/phone/smart-home/technical support. Posts mentioning vehicles, drivers, taxis, vans (Sprinter, etc.) are NEVER IT/Tech.
- "Plumbing" includes any rørlegger/rørleggerarbeid, setting up pipes for kitchens or bathrooms, AND relocating plumbing to a different room within a home (e.g. "kjøkken som skal flyttes fra et rom til et annet").
- "Painting / Renovation" covers carpentry (snekker), building custom items, woodwork, construction. NOT for cleaning/washing apartments.
- "Cleaning / Garden" is for ANY apartment/house cleaning task: vasking, gulvvask, utvask, rengjøring, sengetøy, taking out trash, surface wiping, window washing. If the post asks for help CLEANING, it's Cleaning / Garden.
- "Assembly / Furniture" is for assembling pre-made/flat-pack items (IKEA, shelves, TV mounting).
- "Manual Labor" is for heavy lifting, carrying, demolition, removal work.
- Use "Other" for posts that genuinely don't fit any specific category.
- Extract the location if mentioned (city, area, or district name).

EXAMPLES:
- "Trenger hjelp med flyttevask, innbo skal kastes, men noen ting må gamles til loppemarked" → primary: "Cleaning / Garden", secondary: ["Transport / Moving"]
- "Trenger å flytte en sofa fra 3.etg ned til bilen" → primary: "Transport / Moving", secondary: ["Manual Labor"]
- "Sparkle, slipe og male et rom + montere ny lampe" → primary: "Painting / Renovation", secondary: ["Electrical"]
- "Trenger hjelp til å kaste søppel, noe bæring involvert" → primary: "Manual Labor", secondary: ["Transport / Moving"]
- "Montere tilhengerfeste med software på en Volvo XC90" → primary: "Car Mechanic", secondary: [] (work ON a vehicle)
- Building foldable wall panels by a carpenter → primary: "Painting / Renovation", secondary: []
- "Ønsker pris på rørleggerarbeid til bad, samt opplegg og montering av rør til kjøkken som skal flyttes fra naborom til stue" → primary: "Plumbing", secondary: [] (rørlegger work + relocating kitchen plumbing within a home is NOT transport)
- "Jeg trenger sjåfør til Sprinter 9-seter med rullestoltilpassing, tilknyttet Asker Taxi 07000" → primary: "Transport / Moving", secondary: [] (driver/taxi/vehicle = Transport, NOT IT/Tech)
- "Søker serveringshjelp med erfaring til privat kinesisk nyttår selskap" → primary: "Other", secondary: [] (catering/serving/event staffing = Other, NOT Assembly)
